American Institute of Chemical Engineers,"The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers.

The mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally.

AIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth.

In 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves.

Today AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.",https://www.instagram.com/aicheatucla/,aiche@ucla.edu,http://aiche.seas.ucla.edu/

After realizing that other student organizations would not be able to provide all of these to their members, the founders decided that creating a fraternity, something that was new in Latino culture, would be the best opportunity for achieving its goals. -- Our founders instilled in us the principles of Academic Excellence, through which we will encourage and support Latino males in higher education; Community Service, through which we will give back to the communities that shaped our lives; and the Maintenance of Latino Culture through Brotherhood in establishing the FIRST Latino-Based Organization on the West Coast. -- In 2000, when six gentlemen realized that other student organizations at UCLA would not be able to provide them with opportunities for personal growth, networking, and a chance to contribute meaningfully to both the UCLA campus and the surrounding community, they decided to establish a chapter of this fraternity to provide them the opportunity to achieve these goals. -- Eta Chapter prides itself on being established at the number one public university in the nation.

Through a combination of brotherhood, service, and leadership development, the fraternity strives to create well-rounded individuals who are prepared to lead and inspire others to excel. -- Eta Chapter offers a supportive environment where individuals can cultivate lifelong friendships, engage in philanthropic endeavors, and participate in various social and educational activities.

Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS).

Psi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at over 1,000 senior colleges and universities in the USA and Canada. The Central Office is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters.

What are the Goals of Psi Chi?

Psi Chi serves two major goals. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.",https://www.instagram.com/psichi_at_ucla/,uclapsichi@gmail.com,https://uclapsichi.weebly.com/

Youth Empowerment in Science (Y.E.S.) at UCLA,"YES at UCLA is an organization inspiring the next generation of scientists through a team of highly motivated, undergraduate educators. Our ultimate vision is to show young students (3rd to 5th graders) that anyone, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status, can find success in the field of science.  We will fulfill this mission by holding science lessons at schools in the LA area.  New members will be trained to work with children, contact schools of their choice, prepare small lectures, and ultimately lead clinics. Whether members need volunteer hours or simply want to help their community, YES will track their service throughout the year.",https://www.instagram.com/yesatucla/,yesatucla@gmail.com,https://www.yesatucla.com/
